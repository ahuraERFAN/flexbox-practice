            Our mission as Team Xbox is to bring the joy and community of gaming
            to everyone on the planet, but it’s critical we do so while taking
            care of the planet. We are working to reduce our environmental
            impact and creating opportunities for gamers to make decisions that
            can reduce their environmental impact while gaming.
